To compile and run - go to the folder where cky.py resides. run. I have the output files collected in data/OUTPUT_FILES
$ python3 cky.py pcfg-example.txt sentences-example.txt > OUTPUT_FILES/sentences.txt.cky
for pcky,
$ python3 cky.py pcfg-example.txt sentences-example.txt -prob > OUTPUT_FILES/sentences.txt.probcky


The program works fine for cky as well as pcky algoritm and produces the expected output. Please let me know if you need help in running the program.

Thanks!
